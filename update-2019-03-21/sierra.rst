=============

LSD analysis
------------

Tested calling QUDA staggered solver from QEX on SummitDev.
Modified QUDA MILC wrapper to allow not using Naik links (for nHyp).
Some staggered analysis code basically ready, needs testing.

Xiao-Yong has access to Sierra, will test QEX soon.

Have complete Nim wrappers for QUDA (no need to go through MILC wrapper).
Can use this to call other actions or routines (forces).
Will work on adding capabilities as needed.
