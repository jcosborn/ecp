Exascale Preparations
=====================


Summit/Sierra
-------------

Tested calling QUDA staggered solver from QEX on SummitDev.
Modified QUDA MILC wrapper to allow not using Naik links (for nHyp).
Some staggered analysis code basically ready, needs testing.

Xiao-Yong has access to Sierra, will test QEX soon.

Have complete Nim wrappers for QUDA (no need to go through MILC wrapper).
Can use this to call other actions or routines (forces).
Will work on adding capabilities as needed.


Aurora
------

Exploring design for Aurora port.

All Aurora ESP project members should have access to some limited
information soon.

A few select members will get full access.  Five from LQCD ESP.
